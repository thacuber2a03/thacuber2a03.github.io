my choice of platforms to post to, was... unpredictable, to say the least. the only relatively consistent platform so far has been YouTube.

some of the older ones weren't even released on outside of it, and two of them were released on on SoundCloud, back when I was a frequent user of the app.
generally, anything before *about* 2022 I consider an ["oldie"](/older-music).
