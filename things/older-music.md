# older music releases

these were things I released back when I was starting tracking and maybe even music in general.
most of these songs don't represent my style of composition anymore, or so I think. tread carefully, I guess...

### Running Between Clouds

### 5 Instruments or Less (5IOL)

released somewhere around 2021. I lost the original date.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8OPbNhsgKm66EdleUOXI54uVRarALTAA)

my first attempt at an album. eponymously, every track within has less than 5 instruments.
I think I lost the modules to confirm it, so just take my word for it.

nowadays I don't write music quick enough to make a new album, but it'd be nice to try again, at least for an EP.

## made in [Bandlab for mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bandlab.bandlab)

### Gameboy Tune

released December 26th, 2020.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRLA9VM7QJU)

this one is mostly sample flips, and isn't even finished...

## made in [Bandpass](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lunarlabsoftware.grouploop)

### Break Beat

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_jZsrJSgSs)

this one is also drag and drop, but at least its finished. ironic.
