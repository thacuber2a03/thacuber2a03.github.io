# bookmarks

this page hosts the various links to tools/games/resources/anything I find fun, interesting and/or useful.

I describe just enough to explain each link, not going into too much detail unless I feel like commenting on it or if it would otherwise be hard to navigate/understand.

they're not sorted in any order, but the category links are sorted alphabetically. here are they:

- [code repositories](#repos)
- [computer graphics](#graphics)
- [game development](#gamedev)
- [immediate gui](#imgui)
- [interesting videos](#vids)
- [music resources](#musicres)
- [other nice websites](#interwebs)
- [other resouce compilations](#infocomps)
- [programming language development](#pldev)
- [programming languages](#proglangs)
- [small programs](#tinybins)
- [some tunez](#music)
- [systems programming stuff](#lowlevel)

and [here's the button to go back](https://thacuber2a03.github.io/).

[changelog](/bookmarks/changelog)

<h2 id="repos">code repositories</h2>

- **[jonesforth](https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth) -- [Richard WM. Jones](https://rwmj.wordpress.com)** \
  a public domain FORTH system implemented in one x86 file and one FORTH file that also doubles as a tutorial.

- **[rxi](https://github.com/rxi)** \
  makes really useful and varied libraries, mostly in C and Lua. developer of lite, json.lua, microui, fe and many, many others. \
  <sub>(I am aware that this is a user, not a code repository.)</sub>

- **[stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) -- [nothings](https://github.com/nothings)** \
  *the* header-only library repository. contains libraries that range from decoding/encoding images and OGG Vorbis audio files to voxel geometry rendering, all in the public domain.

<h2 id="vids">interesting videos</h2>

these are either video essays, experiments or playlists of videos that don't really fit on other categories

- **[one hit wonders (and their other songs)](https://youtu.be/bLjLnQl2GHg) -- [boogiehead](https://www.youtube.com/@boogieheadmusic)** \
  a listing of some [one-hit wonders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hit_wonder), normally in the US, with a second song they recorded that's popular in other countries.

<h2 id="gamedev">game development</h2>

- **[Coding Math](https://www.youtube.com/@codingmath)** \
  a series of videos on various math topics related to and useful for game development, ranging from physics, to tweening, to a bit of UI. says "ongoing", but the last video released 7 years ago.

- **[Game Physics Cookbook](https://gamephysicscookbook.com/) -- [Gabor Szauer](https://gaborszauer.com)** \
  a guide on the algebra and math behind physics engines. I don't like it a lot because it's written like if it was a highschool class, but it's nice regardless.

- **[2D Parametric Collision Detection](https://fotino.me/2d-parametric-collision-detection/) and [2D Rigid Body Collision Response](https://fotino.me/2d-rigid-body-collision-response/) -- [Robert Fotino](https://fotino.me)** \
  two articles that go on detail about a collision detection algorithm based on parametric equations,
  and an impulse-based constraint solver, respectively.

- **[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) -- [Robert Nystrom](https://stuffwithstuff.com)** \
  this book goes over various programming patterns that are useful for game or game engine design. \
  from the writer of Crafting Interpreters (this book came before it)

<h2 id="imgui">immediate gui</h2>
<sub>...there aren't as many resources about it as I'd like there to be</sub>

- **[Sol on Immediate Mode GUIs](http://iki.fi/sol/imgui/) -- [Sol_HSA](https://solhsa.com/)** \
  a tutorial on a simple IMGUI system in C that also has keyboard focus. it's written in SDL1, so you might want to translate most calls to SDL 2 or 3.

- **[Immediate-Mode Graphical User Interfaces](https://youtu.be/Z1qyvQsjK5Y) -- [Casey Muratori](https://mollyrocket.com)** \
*the* video about IMGUIs. recorded in 2005, this state-of-the-art 360p video (haha) is an essay explaining the idea of IMGUIs and why they rock. however, it also mentions some important cons to keep in mind, which I respect.

- **[microui](https://github.com/rxi/microui) -- [rxi](https://github.com/rxi)**\
  can't mention simple IMGUIs without mentioning this one. it is a tiny IMGUI system written in ANSI C with zero allocations, and it does not depend on a graphics API either, so it can render on anything that is able to draw rectangles and text.

- **[nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) -- [the Immediate-Mode-UI community](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI)** \
  originally written by [Micha Mettke](https://github.com/vurtun), it is a public-domain, header-only GUI library written in ANSI C, that mantains little state and does not handle OS inputs or windows. it also contains radio buttons, combo boxes, and progress bars, as well as complex graphics functions and basic image handling.

- **[suit](https://github.com/vrld/suit) -- [Matthias Richter](https://github.com/vrld)** \
an IMGUI specifically designed for the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) game framework. it contains a flexible styling system that allows for drawing just about anything, as well as a layouting system decoupled from the UI itself.

<h2 id="graphics">computer graphics</h2>

- **[Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) --
    [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley),
    [Trevor David Black](https://github.com/trevordblack),
    [Steve Hollasch](https://github.com/hollasch)** \
  a public domain (CC0) series of books that teaches the reader how to write a tiny raytracer with more than just circles.

- **[An Introduction to Shader Art Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY) -- [kishimisu](https://www.youtube.com/@kishimisu)** \
  what it says on the tin. does a small overview on the math needed to make shader art while making a small shader.

- **[Building Collision Simulations: An Introduction to Computer Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eED4bSkYCB8) -- [Reducible](https://www.youtube.com/@Reducible)** \
  I really like this video. this video builds a particle collision simulation, and goes over various topics to speed it up with a higher amount of particles.

- **[Performance optimizations for voxel graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40JzyaOYJeY) -- [Vercidium](https://www.youtube.com/@Vercidium)** \
  this video goes over various space and performance optimizations you can apply to voxel rendering engines.

> you may notice the link's name above doesn't match with the video's title. that's because I used the title assigned to it by [Dearrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app/) because it's not as clickbait or as sensationalist as the video's title.
> I might do the same with some other YouTube links; if the title doesn't match, it's likely using Dearrow's version of it.

<h2 id="musicres">music resources</h2>

- **[Notes on Music Theory](https://badd10de.dev/notes/music-theory.html) -- [Bad Diode](https://badd10de.dev/)** \

- **[muted.io](https://muted.io) -- [Sébastien](https://muted.io/about)** \
  interactive tools for practicing an instrument, studying specific music concepts informally or just for jamming and kidding around.

- **[An overview on procedural music generation using math and code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le7OHZJ20pE) -- [Ryan Hedgecock](https://www.youtube.com/@rhedgeco)** \
  goes over the basics of generating audio and music using math and code, in a language-agnostic way. *Dearrow'd title.*

<h2 id="lowlevel">systems programming stuff</h2>

- **[Threaded code explained in C](https://dram.page/p/threaded-code) -- [dramforever](https://dram.page)** \

<h2 id="music">some tunez</h2>

this is, straight up, just links to music I like to listen to, with links to the artist and the album the song is from, if applicable. if no official playlist exists, I might make one and put links to that instead.

> note: the categories they are in don't imply they're only reachable there. it's just that that was the first place I found the song at.
